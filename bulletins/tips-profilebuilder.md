This concept combines a player's experience points (XP) across all games into a single score, giving them a comprehensive view of their overall progress. The XP gained from winning games adds to their overall progress, which they can use to advance to new levels and unlock special ranks or badges.

## Double XP

Players can purchase consumable items from the in-game shop to temporarily receive double the amount of experience points (XP) for each win. This boost can greatly accelerate the player's progression and help them quickly level up. Double XP expires after one hour, providing a limited window of opportunity for players to make the most of the boost.
