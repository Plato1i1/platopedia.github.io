#### Incentive Bonus

Merchants receive an incentive bonus from the requester's end.

- Incentive bonus is determined by the total value of the items you're trading for. It's not counted separately for each item.
- If the trade value exceeds 10,000, there will be a separate incentive bonus. For example, if the trade value is 12,000, the merchants will receive an extra bonus of 500 for the additional 2,000 according to our incentive bonus table. The bonus for each trade value is listed below.

- Both parties are only allowed to exchange items, and must not involve any other types of exchanges.
- Both parties are advised to take screenshots or screen recordings during a trade.
- If there's an issue, you must report to the group owners.

- You must be a member of the group to claim the insurance.
- The insurance only applies when trading with one of our merchants.
