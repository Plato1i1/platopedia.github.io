                    <p>
                        This concept would allow users to personalize their profile by changing the color of their username. By having a unique username color, users can stand out in a sea of generic names and make a bold statement. Users can purchase new and unique color designs from the shop, further expanding their customization options.

                    <p>
                        This concept would allow players to see how many others are spectating their game. A high spectator count can create a sense of excitement and competition, encouraging players to perform at their best.

                    <p>
                        This concept for Brawlbots 2v2 adds an exciting twist to gameplay. Players can collect a very rare power-up that spawns in the middle of the map once per game. It has the ability to bring fallen teammates back to life with 25% HP. No longer will they have to leave the game or watch from the sidelines. Instead, they can wait for their opportunity to be revived, giving them a second chance to fight for victory.

                    <p>
                        This feature would allow players to quickly and easily search for specific items within their inventory. This can save players time and effort, as they no longer have to scroll through their entire inventory to find what they are looking for. The ability to search for items by name, type, or any other relevant criteria ensures that players can find what they need quickly and efficiently.
