                    <p>We currently don't have the option of gifting items to players in public rooms or groups. It's a feature that would make those spaces even more interactive and fun.</p>
                    <p>In this concept, we are able to select and gift anyone from the list of online participants. Public gifts are announced in the chat for all to see, but we need to ensure that the gift messages are not too intrusive.</p>
                    <p>Why would anyone choose to publicly gift players? It's a show of appreciation and, for some, a flex. &#129297;</p>

                    <p>The "Ghost" can be purchased as an item, such as a badge. Once equipped, users will no longer see you in the online list of public rooms or groups. This protects player privacy by preventing others from sending friend requests, and helps avoid unwanted interactions in public chat. We need to ensure that the item is costly, as we don't want our entire community to be ghosted.</p>
                    <p>Note: Even if some players are ghosted, the online list will still show the actual number of online players.</p>

                    <p>It's difficult to keep track of inactive group members, and group admins often kick players at random to free up space. It would be helpful if there was a separate list which displayed members who had the least amount of activity (time spent online in the group). This should help large groups in replacing inactive members with new active members, resulting in a more active group.</p>

                    <p>Currently, groups can have a maximum of 500 members. This isn't practical for very active groups, and active members must be removed to make room for new members. The maximum number of members should be preliminarily increased to 1000. To limit lag, the maximum number of members online at any one time should remain at 500.</p>

                    <p>Groups tend to become crowded with online players during tournaments or important events, making it difficult for hosts to effectively share important announcements while the group chat is flooded with messages. It would be very useful for group admins to be able to mute or block messages from group members indefinitely.</p>

                    <p>A URL within a message is automatically converted to a clickable hyperlink that links directly to the website. There are risks associated with clicking unknown links, including tracking, phishing, malware etc. Whether they click intentionally or accidentally, it would be safer to provide an intermediate redirect notice, perhaps outlining the risks.</p>

                    <p>Players who have registered their accounts will see a new "Account Password" option in Settings. It would allow them to create a password for their accounts, which they can later use to change their registered email.</p>
                    <p>In case of a forgotten password, they can reset it using a one-time code sent to their registered email. If they do not have access to the registered email, they will be unable to reset the password.</p>

                    <h2>Profile / Badge Slots @abc</h2>
                    <p>Currently, there are up to 7 slots available next to a player's username for badges, 5 for gold stars, 1 for a chat badge, and 1 for a standard badge.</p>
                    <p>Players are restricted in how they can use these slots. Each gold star they own takes up a slot and cannot be removed. A chat badge is automatically applied when they use a chat bubble. They only have full control over the 1 standard badge slot.</p>
                    <p>In this concept, every player initially has 2 badge slots. Up to 5 more additional badge slots can be purchased for 10,000 coins each. They can add, remove and reorder badges in these slots.</p>
                    <p>As part of the migration, gold stars and chat badges become standard badges. Players who currently own gold stars will initially have that number of additional badge slots i.e. 4 gold stars = 6 badge slots.</p>
                    <p>This will let players have more control over how their profile looks, allowing them to be more creative and unique. They will be able to make use of duplicate badges they currently own. It gives them an incentive to purchase duplicate badges (7 red pixels) or sets of badges (all cats).</p>
