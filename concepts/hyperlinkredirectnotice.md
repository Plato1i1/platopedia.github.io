A URL within a message is automatically converted to a clickable hyperlink that links directly to the website. There are risks associated with clicking unknown links, including tracking, phishing, malware etc. Whether they click intentionally or accidentally, it would be safer to provide an intermediate redirect notice, perhaps outlining the risks.
