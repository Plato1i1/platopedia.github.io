An option to share item links with your friends on Plato or any platform that supports links. Here's how it could work:

• After opening an item from the shop or your collection, press the link button to grab the link, which you can then share with your friends.

• When your friend opens the link, they will see a preview of the item and an option to purchase or gift to a friend.

This concept would be useful, especially for gifting friends, item trading or giveaways.
