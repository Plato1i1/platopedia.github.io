## Inventory Search

This feature would allow players to quickly and easily search for specific items within their inventory. This can save players time and effort, as they no longer have to scroll through their entire inventory to find what they are looking for. The ability to search for items by name, type, or any other relevant criteria ensures that players can find what they need quickly and efficiently.

## Revive Player (Brawlbots 2v2)

This concept for Brawlbots 2v2 adds an exciting twist to gameplay. Players can collect a very rare power-up that spawns in the middle of the map once per game. It has the ability to bring fallen teammates back to life with 25% HP. No longer will they have to leave the game or watch from the sidelines. Instead, they can wait for their opportunity to be revived, giving them a second chance to fight for victory.
