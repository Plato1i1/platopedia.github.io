title: Group / Increase Members @abc

Currently, groups can have a maximum of 500 members. This isn't practical for very active groups, and active members must be removed to make room for new members. The maximum number of members should be preliminarily increased to 1000. To limit lag, the maximum number of members online at any one time should remain at 500.
