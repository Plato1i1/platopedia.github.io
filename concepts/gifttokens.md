Gift tokens can be purchased or gifted from the shop. Each costing only 250 coins, it's not just an item, but a token that you and your friends can collect and later use to claim exclusive packs.

- New exclusive packs containing *very rare* items are added to the shop every month.
- Exclusive packs can only be purchased from the shop with gift tokens.
- Prices of exclusive packs may vary from 50 to 250 gift tokens, depending on the rarity of items they contain.
