The "Ghost" can be purchased as an item, such as a badge. Once equipped, users will no longer see you in the online list of public rooms or groups. This protects player privacy by preventing others from sending friend requests, and helps avoid unwanted interactions in public chat. We need to ensure that the item is costly, as we don't want our entire community to be ghosted.

Note: Even if some players are ghosted, the online list will still show the actual number of online players.
