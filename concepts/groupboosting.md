A premium feature that enables group owners to improve the credibility and discoverability of their groups. In this concept, group owners have the option to "boost" their groups to unlock limited-time perks, such as a verification badge. Additionally, they gain access to a public feed where boosted or verified groups can share announcements. The boost expires after 7 days and can be reactivated for a set amount of coins.
