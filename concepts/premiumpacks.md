**This is just a concept.**

Premium packs contain *very rare* items and can only be obtained through in-app purchases.

- Items inside a premium pack cannot be gifted or purchased with coins.
- New premium packs are added to the shop every month, old ones are occasionally and temporarily re-added to the shop.
