Currently, when a player misses their turn in a 2v2 game, the turn is passed to their opponent. This approach has a significant flaw as it allows AFKs to unfairly influence the direction of the game. To address the adverse impact of AFKs in 2v2 games, I propose a new system that would fundamentally alter how these games are played. 

In this concept, if a player misses their turn, the turn is passed to their teammate instead of the opponent, resulting in a much fairer 2v2 game. To prevent potential exploitation of this new approach, any player who misses two turns, even if not in succession, will be eliminated from the game.

Supported games: Pool, Table Soccer, Bowling.
