**This is just a concept.**

This concept can help players secure their accounts and safely change their registered email without compromising account security.

Players who have registered their accounts will see a new "Account Password" option in Settings. It would allow them to create a password for their accounts, which they can later use to change their registered email.

In case of a forgotten password, they can reset it using a one-time code sent to their registered email. If they do not have access to the registered email, they will be unable to reset the password.
