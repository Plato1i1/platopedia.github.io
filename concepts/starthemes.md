**This is just a concept.**

At present, the Gold Star only has one theme, appealing to some but not all. How about an option to purchase a variety of Star Themes using PIPs? That way, players can have more control over how they want their profiles to look. The optional themes would be available to those who already own the Gold Star, and they can simply swap the standard design for a new one that better fits them.
